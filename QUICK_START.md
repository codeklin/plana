## 💡 Money Management Tips (For Nigerians)

### The 50/30/20 Rule
- **50%** of income → Needs (rent, food, bills)
- **30%** → Wants (entertainment, shopping)
- **20%** → Savings/Emergency

**Example for ₦150,000:**
- ₦75,000 → Needs
- ₦45,000 → Wants
- ₦30,000 → Savings

→ Use Plana to track if you're hitting these targets!

### For Daily Traders 🏪
1. Add daily income at end of day
2. Track all expenses immediately
3. Check Calendar to see daily net (income - expense)
4. Weekly total shows your profit

### For Salaried Workers 💼
1. Add salary when you receive it
2. List all planned expenses upfront
3. Track actual spending as you go
4. Compare actual vs. planned at month-end

### For Freelancers 🎨
1. Create separate income for each client/project
2. Track project-specific expenses
3. Calculate true profit per project
4. Plan for taxes (20% set aside)
